Conditional Support
=====================================

Would have been a service that let people state to the system how much support the project would need to get before they'd be willing to support it themselves. Nobody would need to stick their neck out and support it unconditionally, and the system would decide when to launch and who to inform of their participation. Abandoned, though, when I decided it wasn't bringing enough that you can't already do with kickstarter and a survey.

If anyone else wants to push it ahead though, we should certainly talk. I know things.
